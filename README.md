# Blackjack-Analyzer
Program analyzes logical steps of turns in game and outputs on what step it is meaningless to continue playing.

---IMPORTANT---

Pay attention to the directory structure!

Input and output files are stored in folders, therefore when files are passed to the variables in the code the path locations are relative.
Therefore, keep that in mind and feel free to change it.
